Object Oriented Programming
Polymorphism: "Many forms." 
The same message can be sent to more than one
kind of object. In conventional programming, the programmer is
responsible for choosing functions that operate properly on a given
data type, in object-oriented programming, the data type (the
object) is responsible for providing the appropriate
implementation.

For example: A Software Engineer is considered a polymorphism.
A software Engineer is a human, which is a mammal. And he is also a coder.
